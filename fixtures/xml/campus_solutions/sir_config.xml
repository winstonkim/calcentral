      <DESCR_LONG>We sincerely hope that you will accept our invitation to join the Berkeley Law student body in August.
        We are aware that you may have applied to other law schools and that many factors may determine where you will
        attend law school this year. In lieu of a seat deposit, we will rely on your word of honor to hold a place in
        our class. Because our Early Interview Week (EIW) bidding process begins on July 18, we ask that you do this
        promptly and no later than 5:00 p.m. PDT on July 15. We want to ensure that you are entered into the Career
        Development system and able to participate in that program. Declaration of your intent to enroll is a
        prerequisite to participate in our Early Interview Week. You must also certify that you are not participating
        in, and will not participate in, any other school’s on-campus interview program. A false certification not only
        puts your interviews at risk, but will also be considered a violation of the Student Honor Code. Details are
        found under the Career Development website. If you accept our admission offer and declare your intent to enroll
        we will presume that you will withdraw your applications at all other law schools and that you will not make a
        deposit nor submit a letter of intent at another school. You also agree to notify us immediately if you decide
        not to enroll or if your plans otherwise change so as to affect your matriculation.
