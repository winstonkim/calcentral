# Our campus DB may contain data for many semesters excluded from CalCentral. Semesters of interest vary by
# functional domain:
#
#   * My Academics :
#       - Currently running term (if any; there are gaps between terms)
#       - Past terms back to a configured cut-off
#       - The next term, when available
#       - In Spring, the next Fall term, when available
#   * My Classes :
#       - Currently running term, if any; otherwise the next term
#   * bCourses course provisioning & refreshes :
#       - Currently running term (if any)
#       - The next term, when available
#       - In Spring, the next Fall term, when available
#   * FinAid :
#       - Always display the "current Aid Year", which is defined as:
#           - After the end of the Summer term, the next calendar year
#           - Up to and including the last day of this year's Summer term, the current calendar year
#       - Also display the "next Aid Year" between "the day admissions letters are released"
#         and the last day of Summer term. The admissions-release day is not available in the
#         campus DB, and so it is maintained in the CalCentral application DB.
#   * OEC :
#       - Still manually configured for now.
